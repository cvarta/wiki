Jointly developed at multiple companies, Btrfs is licensed under the GPL and open for contribution from anyone. Not too many companies have said that they are using Btrfs in production, but we welcome those who can say so on the production users page. Why use Btrfs BtrFS filesystem in Linux provides the following Features and Capabilities Built-in copy on write Powerful snapshot capabilities Built-in volume management with subvolumes Massive Scalability upto 16 Exabytes Built-in data integrity (checksums) SSD optimization Compression capabilities RAID built in BtrFS Manual defragmentation Online filesystem management Data and metadata integrity In-place conversion from ext2/3/4 and ReiserFS Quota groups Online expansion and reduction of filesystem size Object level RAID Seeding devices Support for multiple devices Installation Check Kernel Support Btrfs filesystem has been integrated into the kernel.
